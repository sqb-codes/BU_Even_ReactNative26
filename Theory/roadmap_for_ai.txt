=======================================

LLMs
- LLM is a neural network trained to predict the next token based on previous token
We need to understand how tokens flow through the model...

msg = Hello how are you
tokens -> ["hello", "how", "are", "you"]

Think of LLM as:
- that takes input tokens
- runs through a very large mathematical pipeline
- and returns probabilities of next token

Tokens: The core unit
Cost = number of tokens
Context length = max tokens
Performance = token efficiency

pipeline: text -> Tokenizer -> Embeddings -> Transformer Layers -> Output probabilities

Token: Input is split into tokens
Embeddings: Each token is converted into a vector (number)
Transformer Layer: Self attention + Feed forward + Residual Connections + Layer Normalization

Self-attention:
Which previous tokens are important for the current token...
